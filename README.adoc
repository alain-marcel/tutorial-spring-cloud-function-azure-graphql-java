== Context
GraphQL using Spring Boot works well.  
See for example https://github.com/sambenskin/graphql-spring-boot-tutorial/blob/master/Readme.md  
Just download and execute.

GraphQL with Spring Cloud Function and azure is the challenge.  
This project contains an "hello world" application, but it still not works with azure function. 


== Package the application
Download from this site and execute : mvn clean package

== Launch with ide_spring_boot__run_app.bat
----
POST http://localhost:8080/graphql with body { "query": "{pets{name}}" }  
----

This will return {"data":{"pets":[{"name": "Billou" }, {"name": "Boullou" }


== Launch with ide_azure__run_app.bat (run azure function locally)
----
POST http://localhost:7071/api/graphql with body { "query": "{pets{name}}" }  
----
This will return an error
